This is an implementation of a LeNet convolutional neural network model trained to be able to diagnose Malaria, given an image of a cell segment. This implementation 
has feature extractor layer with 2 convolutional, 2 normalization and 2 Pooling Layers. After the pre - processing layer has completed, there is a neural network 
with 2 layers (1000 and 100 neurons). In total, there are a total of 4.6 million parameters to train. 

The dataset used for this contains 27,558 labelled images and is freely available on the Tensorflow website.
